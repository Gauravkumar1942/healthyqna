	<p class="post-text">Why does everyone even care about testosterone? Having low testosterone can create a lot of unwanted symptoms like low libido, low energy, difficulty concentrating and losing muscle mass. So, not only does it cause these really frustrating symptoms, it can also be a risk factor for other really scary things like heart disease, metabolic syndrome, which includes diabetes and hypertension, osteoporosis, and even death. So making sure that your testosterone levels are optimal is really important.</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Weight Loss</h2>

	<p class="post-text">Why does it even matter to lose weight? Well, the reason being is that obesity or being overweight means that you have more fat cells and fat cells actually have a specific enzyme in them which takes all that good healthy testosterone and converts it into estradiol (female hormone). How much weight do you really need to lose?
</p>




<p class="post-text">So in one study, they looked at the amount of weight loss that was needed to increase testosterone levels and they found that an average of 21 kilograms or nearly 46 pounds was the average amount of weight loss by people who did increase their testosterone level, but do you really need to lose 46 pounds?</p>

 <p class="post-text">Well sure. That would be great. But another study looked specifically at physical activity and diet and how did those contribute to increasing testosterone? So, what that study concluded was that increasing your activity level could actually reduce the amount of weight loss that you need. If you increase your physical activity, you might actually need to lose, even less weight, something like 12 kilograms or 26 pounds. And that brings us to our second suggestion.</p>


<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Exercise</h2>



	<p class="post-text">So, exercises are important for testosterone. But what kind of exercise should I just go for ? A walk? Well actually people have studied this. So, researchers looked at young healthy men who are already physically active and they put them into two categories. They put them into a steady state exercise where they ran to achieve a certain output for 40 to 45 minutes. So the other half were put into a group of high intensity exercise. And what that means is they went for 90 seconds at a really high output and 90 seconds in a recovery zone. And they did that for about 42 to 47 minutes. </p>


	<p class="post-text">They measured their blood levels before the exercise, after the exercise and 12 hours later. And they found that those who did the high intensity interval training did actually increase their testosterone levels significantly more than those who did steady straight training.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">However, after 12 hours, they found that this highness, the interval training, actually had a lower testosterone level, and researchers hypothesised that participants were actually using that testosterone to help recover during that time.</p>


	<p class="post-text">So yes, there may be some benefit to doing high intensity interval exercise rather than just going for a walk or going on steady state exercise. So my take-home is, do some high intensity interval training for a short burst of time and that will increase your testosterone level and be easier to really do on a regular basis. You can't lose weight without going to diet, which is our third recommendation.
</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Diet</h2>

	<p class="post-text">There are foods that might be better to help boost your testosterone, but how much do you need to eat to make a real impact? It's hard to say. Avoid processed foods, eat natural foods, fruits and vegetables that you find at the supermarket produce aisle. </p>
	<p class="post-text">I actually found an interesting study on the keto diet and testosterone, this very recent study that just came out in 2020. They looked at the national health and examination survey  which is nationally done. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">So, looking at people all over the country in the United States and getting a lot of information about their diet, their activity level and blood and urine samples, to obtain data that can be used to find correlations between certain things.</p>


	<p class="post-text">And so, what this group did was they looked at the dietary-type of men and their testosterone levels, what they found was that men who restricted fat in their diet were likely to have a lower testosterone level than those who didn't restrict fat in their diet. So does that mean you should eat fatty foods?</p>


	<p class="post-text">If you are a normal individual, who wants to boost your testosterone, I would not limit fats in your diet. Because that may be actually limiting your ability for your body to produce testosterone. But if you're overweight, improving your weight is more important than changing the components of your diet.</p>


	<p class="post-text">Also, I get a lot of questions about soy products, so are soy products gonna make my testosterone level drop ? So, the reason this comes up is because soy has an oestrogen-like compound called ISOFLAVONES (oestrogen compound) which is concerning for people who want to increase their testosterone level. But what does the data really say?</p>


	<p class="post-text">So a 2010 meta analysis looked at 47 different studies and compiled all the data, and what they found, even a really high intake of soy would not reduce your testosterone levels and I'll tell you about one of these studies because I thought it was really interesting. This study took young men between the ages of 18 and 30 and they were randomised for a period of weeks to twice a day. Take either a vanilla flavoured soy protein or a vanilla flavoured whey  protein or vanilla flavoured cake mix. And so, you didn't know what they were gonna get these little plastic baggies with them, and they were supposed to take it for four weeks and see how it impacted their testosterone levels.</p>



	<p class="post-text">And what this study found was that even this high intake of soy proteins, which was the equivalent of 41.5  grams of soy protein per day, did not affect testosterone levels, even after taking it consistently for four weeks.</p>


	<p class="post-text">So my advice to you is, don't worry too much about the soy products that you're eating. Especially if you're getting good healthy protein from soy products. It's probably not going to impact your testosterone levels. That's what the data says.
</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Good Sleep</h2>


	<p class="post-text">So how does sleep impact your testosterone levels?  So there's actually two interesting studies on this. Once they looked at 2,300 men in that same national health and nutrition examination survey and they found that with each hour of sleep that people reported getting less, their testosterone decreased by almost six points.</p>



	<p class="post-text">So sleep is super super important. Recent data has suggested that it might be related to the time when you wake up. So there may be some circadian rhythm associations. So if you're waking up really, really early, that may be more detrimental to your testosterone level than going to sleep a little bit later.</p>


	<p class="post-text">So, the bottom line is get better sleep and sleep for longer periods of time. So try to reduce sleep interruptions. Avoid looking at your phone before bed time and try to really get into a bedtime routine and go to sleep around the same time and wake up around the same time each and every day.</p>



	

<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Avoid Endocrine distrupting chemicals</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Being exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals can actually result in a number of problems. It has been found to be associated with not only low testosterone but diabetes, obesity, learning problems and even cancer. So endocrine disrupting chemicals are found throughout our environment due to pollution in certain cosmetics or consumable items as well as plastics. The most popular of these are called BPAs or Bisphenol A. And how do these actually work to impact your testosterone levels? So they actually disrupt endocrine action. And testosterone is created through an endocrine process.</p>


	<p class="post-text">And another study looking at the enhance database, looked at young adults and young kids and found out their level of BPA exposure by looking at the urinary concentration and also correlated this with their testosterone level and they found that in adolescent boys, having a higher amount or higher exposure to BPAs was correlated with a lower testosterone level.</p>


	<p class="post-text">So how can you avoid BPAs? Well, avoid using plastic containers, use alternatives like glass or metal or other things and don't warm things up in plastic containers. You can also look for products that are labelled BPA free.</p>
