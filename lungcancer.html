	<p class="post-text">Lung cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide; more people die of lung cancer than colorectal, liver and breast cancers combined.</p>
	<p class="post-text">About half of all lung cancers are diagnosed after it has already metastasized. At this point, chances of survival are extremely low. The Five-Year survival rate is only 4%.</p>
	<p class="post-text">In contrast, about one in five lung cancers is diagnosed while in the early stage where the cancer is relatively small and contained within the lung. The Five-Year survival rate here is 63% highlighting the importance of early diagnosis. Experts estimate that early screening could allow up to 75 percent of lung cancers to be detected at an earlier more treatable stage of the disease; the most common symptoms are tied to the basic functions of the lungs and may include,</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Coughing</h2>



	<p class="post-text">Coughing that doesn't go away or gets worse. A lung cancer cough isn't easy to identify by type, what sets it apart from other coughs is how long it lasts.  Most coughs caused by other conditions will clear up in a few weeks, but lung cancer coughs are chronic meaning they last longer than eight weeks.Many people with lung cancer say their cough just won't go away.</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Bloody Cough</h2>



	<p class="post-text">Blood and mopped assistance can be a warning sign of lung cancer. In fact it is the only sign present in 30% of people at the time of diagnosis. The blood is often present in small amounts such as what you would find on a blood-tinged tissue, but any amount of blood sputum should be evaluated carefully by your doctor.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Respiratory Infection</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Many people diagnosed with lung cancer say that their symptoms were first dismissed by themselves or even their healthcare providers as being due to a respiratory infection alone. But when lung tumours grow near the airways, they can cause an obstruction that raises the risk of these infections.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Smoking</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Repeated infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis are in fact common before lung cancer is diagnosed for spontaneous smoking cessation. It's been found that a significant number of people with lung cancer reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke or spontaneously quit smoking prior to their diagnosis.</p>
	<p class="post-text">What's interesting is that very few symptoms of withdrawal occur in most cases until recently this cessation was thought to be related to an attempt to coughing or a subconscious fear of developing lung cancer.</p>
	<p class="post-text">However studies now suggest that the ability to stop smoking spontaneously may actually be an early sign of lung cancer. It could be that lung cancers produce chemicals that decrease the addictiveness of nicotine.</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Chest Pain</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Many people mentioned that they feel chest pain before they are diagnosed with lung cancer. The lungs themselves do not have nerves that sense pain but pain can be caused by several things such as the pressure of a tumour on nerves, pain in the ribs from cancer that has spread to the bones, muscle strain or even rib fractures from repeated coughing.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Although not everyone with lung cancer develops these symptoms. These are the symptoms most likely to appear before the disease spreads and becomes more serious. So if you have a bad cough, recurring chest pain or respiratory infections see your family doctor. At the end of the day, you can't go wrong with listening to your body and being cautious.</p>
