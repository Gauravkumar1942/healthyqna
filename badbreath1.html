	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Bacteria</h2>

	<p class="post-text">Of bad breath, the first cause is really bacteria in the mouth. Almost all chronic bad breath is caused by bacteria and we can almost always identify those bacteria and eliminate those bacteria in order to eliminate the bad breath.</p>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Gum Diseases</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Another cause of bad breath is that a lot of people have gum disease, that they're unaware of and that can be a big factor with the odour, because of the bacteria that is hanging out in your gums.</p>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Bad Food
</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Another major cause of bad breath is food that you eat. If you're having food with garlic,  if you're having food with onions, those things can majorly cause bad breath and it'll take a day or so before that goes away.</p>
	<p class="post-text">That's really not chronic bad breath. Chronic bad breath is there almost all of the time and almost all of that time is caused by bacteria.</p>


	<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Dieting</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Dieting is great if you're overweight. Dieting is terrible if you're worried about bad breath because if you are dieting and if you're strictly dieting you can omit what's called Ketone bodies and Ketone bodies are of a very strong and foul odour.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Very often we find that people who are on ketogenic diets, or very high protein diets, have bad breath related to these Ketone bodies.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Very high protein diets have bad breath related to these Ketone bodies and I've noticed some people if they don't have breakfast in the morning can have a very bad breath.
</p>


	<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Oral Hygiene</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Well, if your home care is not good, you're not getting regular cleanings, that can also cause a buildup again of bacteria.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Let's go over the five factors: number one <b>Bacteria</b> in the mouth that are giving off basically sulphur or sulphur related compounds, <b>Gum Disease</b> that can cause bad breath.  Eating the <b>Wrong Foods</b>,  garlic and onions or  highly fermented foods definitely can cause bad odour. Not eating enough or <b>Being on a Diet</b> you can get Ketone bodies also can cause foul odour and there's not getting your teeth cleaned and <b>Not Taking care of your Mouth</b> can cause you to have bad breath.
