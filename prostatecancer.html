	<p class="post-text">Prostate is a vital element of the male biological reproductive system. It's about the size and shape of a walnut. But if left unchecked this small gland can cause big problems. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting people with male reproductive organs. Each year close to 200,000 Americans receive a diagnosis of prostate cancer.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">About one in nine people with a prostate will receive a prostate cancer diagnosis during their lifetime. This includes men, transgender women, intersex people and non-binary people with biologically male sex organs.</p>
	<p class="post-text">One of the best indicators of whether you are at risk for prostate cancer is your family history. You are two to three times more likely to get prostate cancer if your biological father, brother either or son has the disease.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Another risk factor is age, your chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older, it's most common after age 50 and more than half of cases occur in people over age 65.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">There are some other risk factors including race, weight and whether you smoke. Prostate cancer rarely causes symptoms, but as the disease progresses you may experience certain warning signs. So what should you be on the lookout for knowing the symptoms of prostate cancer will help you keep an eye out for any concerning changes to your health. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Keep in mind though these symptoms do not indicate trouble with your prostate and in fact most all of them come standard with ageing. But if you experienced several symptoms or have other concerns, it may be a good idea to visit your urologist.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Most men will have trouble urinating as they age. You might experience a slow or weak urine flow or your urine flow might start and stop beyond your ability to control it. Though this isn't usually due to prostate cancer. It may be a good idea to get your prostate checked.</p>
	<p class="post-text">An early sign of prostate trouble is unexplained pain. Pain in the area of your prostate especially when you're sitting down. This could also indicate a prostate infection. But only your urologist can say for certain.</p>
	<p class="post-text">A tumour on the prostate can put pressure on your bladder and urethra. So take note if you start to feel a frequent and sometimes urgent need to urinate especially at night. You might also feel pain or a burning sensation when you urinate, a condition known as dysuria. This condition is most commonly associated with urinary tract infections, but it can sometimes be a sign of prostate cancer. </p>
	<p class="post-text">You could experience a loss of bladder control as well as problems controlling your bowel movements. It may hurt when you ejaculate or you may not be able to keep an erection and you may notice blood in your semen or urine.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Finally, as prostate cancer progresses it may cause pain in your lower back hips or chest as well as numbness in your legs or feet.  Again, none of these has a surefire sign of prostate cancer, but they might warrant a visit to the doctor to eliminate your risk of getting prostate cancer.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">But, if you're at higher risk for developing the disease, there are steps you can take to lower your risk, get regular prostate screenings, maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, eat a nutritious diet and quit smoking.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Prostate cancer is a serious disease and early detection is key.  Talk to your doctor about your prostate cancer. Sometimes as early as age 40, you should be screened for prostate cancer, sometimes as early as age 40 if you're considered high risk and make sure prostate cancer is diagnosed before it spreads to other parts of the body.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">About 97% of people live at least five years after diagnosis, so pay attention to your prostate. It may be small, but knowing the warning signs can benefit your health in a big way.</p>
