	<p class="post-text">We must know why liver health is important. Consider a cloth that you use for daily cleaning. If it is overloaded with dirt, at some point, it would need a cleanse. Similarly, the liver is our detoxifying organ in the body that converts toxins into waste materials which then get eliminated through different channels.</p>
	<p class="post-text">So if liver function is compromised, toxins get accumulated which then become the reason for various acute and chronic health problems. How do we know if our liver function is compromised? Liver is one of the most hard working organs in the body, with over 500 functions attributed to its name.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Being such a vital organ, any problem in the liver, body is proactive enough to show signs and signals. Most common being pigmentation on skin and premature greying of hair. This clearly shows excess heat in the liver.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">An important function of the liver is to break down fat. So, if you have gained weight, you might just need a liver cleanse. Liver is the storehouse of iron. So if you are anaemic, you need to focus on your iron level. Other important warning signs include chronic fatigue, bad breath, yellowish appearance of skin and eyes, dark yellow urine, loss of appetite, swelling in legs and other body parts, if not acted upon this can cause major damage to the body. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">So why does our liver get toxic? Even though the liver is quite resilient, if it gets overburdened, it loses its efficiency. A lot of factors other than air and water pollution, is drinking, smoking, pesticides in food, over medication, usage of refined oils for cooking, excessive indulgence in preservatives, packaged foods and refined sugar foods.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">These foods overload the liver. Basically the more toxins you expose your body to, the harder it will be for your liver to detoxify. Then every time you get angry or irritated, your liver has to pay the price, as anger is closely related to the health of your liver.
</p>
	<p class="post-text"> It's a known fact that our body detoxifies during deep sleep. Compromising on sleep, doesn't give an opportunity for the liver to recharge. So how do you cleanse the liver? It's simple to reduce the toxic overload and your liver is capable enough to rejuvenate itself.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Ayurvedic scriptures elaborately talk about various herbs that can rejuvenate the liver within a few days. Out of so many, I have selected three ways which are easy, practical and effective. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">The first one is fresh sugarcane juice. Fresh sugarcane juice is a boon to strengthen the liver. No wonder it is recommended by doctors. The antioxidants in sugarcane can protect the liver against infection and maintain the bilirubin levels in control. It gets even better with added ginger and lemon juice. You can have it one or before breakfast in the morning or in the evening. It's not only tasty but also easily available all around the year. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Eating fresh food keeps the liver healthy. Turmeric is among the top foods. Other foods like fenugreek seeds, ginger and jaggery are also great for the liver.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">In fruits, grapes, pears, lemon, coconut and amla (Indian Gooseberry) are highly beneficial, then high fibre foods like whole grains, leafy vegetables, nuts and seeds, beetroot and carrots in any form are rejuvenating for the liver. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">To eliminate the causal factors. There are a few things that can be done. Start using traditional cold pressed oils for cooking, do 15 minutes of yoga daily to stay calm and happy, and avoid foods that play havoc with the liver. Start using cast iron utensils for cooking to optimise liver health.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">To sum up, try to reduce the toxic overload on your liver as much as possible. Include foods that will help strengthen your liver. Do not compromise on your sleep. The liver is our best friend. Take good care of it.
