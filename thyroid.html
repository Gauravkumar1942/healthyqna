	<p class="post-text">Thyroid is a gland that resembles a small butterfly and is situated in the neck serving a critical function in controlling the metabolism, energy levels and general health of the body. When hormone production decreases, it can lead to a range of noticeable symptoms that shouldn't be overlooked.</p>
	<p class="post-text">We'll explore some common signs that could suggest you're low on thyroid hormone enabling you to stay vigilant and take necessary steps for your well-being before we proceed.

	<p class="post-text">When levels of these hormones dip too low, the body's metabolic rate decreases leading to a cascade of effects, including a pronounced feeling of tiredness and a lack of energy. This fatigue can be debilitating making it challenging to engage in daily activities and often leaving you feeling drained and unable to focus on tasks at hand.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Low thyroid hormone levels can also disrupt the balance of other bodily systems causing additional symptoms such as weight gain sensitivity to cold dry skin and brittle hair; the impact of this condition can extend beyond physical well-being, as individuals may also experience mood swings.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Potential connection to the signs and understanding their potential connection to thyroid function is crucial for seeking appropriate medical attention and addressing the underlying cause of the fatigue.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Weight Gain</h2>


	<p class="post-text">When It comes to our body,  weight gain can often be attributed to various factors, some of which are not immediately apparent. One such factor is the delicate balance of the thyroid hormones, the thyroid energy influence that controls how the body uses energy, influencing vital functions such as body temperature, heart rate and even how quickly food is converted into energy or stored as fat.</p>
	<p class="post-text">When the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of these hormones, a condition known as hypothyroidism can occur. One of the hallmark symptoms of hypothyroidism is unexplained weight gain. Weight gain associated with a sluggish thyroid can be perplexing and frustrating as it often is.</p>
	<p class="post-text">It occurs, despite efforts to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine.
