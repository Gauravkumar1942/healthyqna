	<p class="post-text">The American Heart Association estimates that a stroke death occurs just about every three and a half minutes. The average number of daily stroke related deaths  is also a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States, but a stroke isn't a death sentence.</p>
	<p class="post-text">In fact recognizing the signs of stroke and acting fast could help save a life. When a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked or bursts, a stroke occurs.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Two main types of Strokes are : 1) Ischemic, which involves a blockage in the vessels that transport blood to the brain and 2) Hemorrhagic or a stroke that involves bleeding in the brain.</p>
	<p class="post-text">If you don't know the signs of stroke, you're not alone. 30% of people under the age of 45 don't know either but there's a quick and easy way to remember it's an acronym known as BE FAST.</p>
	<p class="post-text">The B stands for Balance. Watch out for balance. Like trouble with standing or walking.</p>
	<p class="post-text">E stands for Eyes. Look for vision changes, this could be blurred vision or vision loss in one or both eyes.</p>
	<p class="post-text">F is for Face. Watch for droopiness on either side of the face or ask if the person's face feels numb, you can always ask them to smile if you're unable to tell.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">A stands for Arm. Check for weakness or numbness in the arms or legs. You can ask the person to raise their arms.</p>
	<p class="post-text">S stands for Speech. See if there are any issues in speech, and listen for speech problems. This might include trouble getting the words out or slurred speech. Ask the person to repeat easy sentences to verify this. </p>
	<p class="post-text">T is for Time. Don't hesitate, call 911 (the emergency number of your country) immediately. Always call to ensure that the person is diagnosed and treated quickly. Never drive someone to the hospital, if they're having a stroke. Emergency Services can get them there faster and relay important information to hospital staff. So now you know the signs of a stroke. Just be fast. You can help someone get the care they need immediately. </p>
