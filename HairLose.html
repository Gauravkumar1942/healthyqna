There could be many causes of hair loss which include dietary choices, nutrients deficiencies, medications, underlying medical conditions, stress, pollution and genetics.

	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Homemade Packs</h2>

After 30 to 40 minutes, rinse your hair with lukewarm water and use mild shampoo.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Another amazing hair pack is Amla, Shikakai and Coconut oil pack. This pack will help in preventing hair fall and getting thick hair. Amla and  shikakai are widely used in Indian home remedies. Amla is rich in vitamin C, antioxidants and flavonoids. This really helps to promote hair growth. Shikakai helps to strengthen hair roots and coconut oil nourishes hair follicles which should prevent breakage.</p>

Now, add 2 tbsp full of coconut oil and heat them on a medium flame, once boiled, strain and transform the oil in a bowl. And let it come to a lukewarm temperature. Massage this oil into your scalp and wash your hair after an hour or the next morning with lukewarm water with mild shampoo.</p>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Oil Massage</h2>


	<p class="post-text">A strong oil massage is a very common tradition. This tradition has been followed by our generations for centuries. Bhringraj oil is one of the best oils to prevent hair fall. It improves blood flow to the roots by increasing the vasodilation process and stimulates hair growth by activating hair follicles. The herb also contains several minerals and vitamins that are helpful to prevent split ends, hair loss and breakages.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Stress is one of the most common reasons for hair loss, bhringraj oil has a relaxing effect that helps to de-stress you. Before you massage the oil onto the scalp. First lukewarm it and this will help in deep penetration into the scalp, gently massage this warm oil for 15 minutes in a circular motion and leave it in the hair for 30 mins or more and later wash it off with mild shampoo.</p>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Hair fall reduction concoction</h2>


	<p class="post-text">The food we eat has an impact on the entire system including organ function, blood flow, nervous system, metabolic rate and so on. As a result, it will definitely have an impact on hair follicles. To see a visible hair fall reduction result, try this nutritious concoction and get a thick hair.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Let's understand how to make this concoction. Take one medium-sized beetroot boiled and chopped into pieces, one small carrot washed, peeled and chopped, 2 small apples peeled and chopped, 1 small cucumber peeled and chopped and one small piece of ginger, blend all these ingredients to form a thick juice, drink it twice a week. This juice will supply you with all the essential nutrients, which will help improve the health of your hair.</p>
	<p class="post-text">If you continue to eat a lot of unhealthy food, your hair will lack sufficient nutrients, and become dull, and prone to breaking, split ends, rough texture and hair loss. These are all symptoms that require an internal remedy. Your diet has to be rich in protein, iron, vitamin C, Omega 3 fatty acids, biotin, vitamin A and vitamin E. Each of these nutrients are essential for hair growth.</p>
