	<p class="post-text">Let's discuss symptoms that tell you that you have an unhealthy gut and ways in which you can maintain good gut health and food that will help you do so. We are all taught in school that the digestive system consists of a stomach and intestines. All the food that we eat is digested and absorbed and excreted from our body. But do you know that the intestine has an incredible variety of microorganisms? They are a total of about 1.5 kgs. These are known as gut microbiota. This gut microbiota is regarded as a fingerprint since every person has a very specific gut microbiota that does not match with anybody else. These microbiota have an important role in deciding if we'll be obese or thin, in deciding our mental health status, our immune status, if we have the risk of getting autoimmune disorders and numerous other health effects. There are a number of ways by which an unhealthy gut manifests itself. So, here are some of the most common symptoms which can tell you that you have an unhealthy gut.</p>

	<br>	<br>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Frequent and Chronic Stomach discomfort</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="post-text">We all suffer from an occasional episode of bloating and diarrhoea, but as long as it is brief and transient, it should be fine. But when bloating, acidity and diarrhoea become frequent, it could be a sign of gut infection and an unhealthy gut microbiota that is not able to process. Inefficient conditions, like irritable bowels, syndrome or IBS are also a sign of an unhealthy gut.</p>
	<br>	<br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Unintentional Weight Changes</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="post-text">If you are someone who weighs a lot and you easily lose weight or gain weight without making any changes to your diet and lifestyle, it could often be an unhealthy gut. Unhealthy gut might create problems with absorption of nutrients in the body, regulation of blood sugar and body fat levels which ultimately reflects in the fluctuation of weight.
</p>
	<br>	<br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Excessive Sugar Cravings
</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="post-text">Excessive sugar cravings often result from our bodyâ€™s inability to absorb nutrients properly from the food that we eat. And this is mostly because of an unhealthy balance of microbes in the gut. For example, there might be growth of too much yeast in our gut, which results in these excessive sugar cravings.
</p>

	<br>	<br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Skin Conditions</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="post-text">It is very well established that skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis result from gut inflammation, which causes something called a leaky gut where undigested food particles or toxins leak from the intestine into our blood. Many dieticians and nutritionists have been able to treat these allergies and skin conditions. So, please treat the gut and restore back to good health.</p>
	<br>	<br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Mental Health Problems</h2>

	<br>
	<p class="post-text">Researchers have now established a sort of communication between our gut microbiota and central nervous system and this bi-directional communication is called the gut brain axis. What it essentially means is that, if something is wrong with our gut microbiota, it could potentially reflect in the form of mental disorders like anxiety or depression.</p>
