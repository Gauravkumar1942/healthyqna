	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Diversity in our Diet</h2>



	<p class="post-text">There are hundreds of species of microorganisms in our gut. Each species plays a different role and has a different requirement of nutrients for their growth. So a diet consisting of a diverse range of foods will encourage the growth of a diversity of microbes in our gut. So let's say if you're someone who eats only rice and tries shooting more millets in your diet, try including a variety of legume stalls and pulses instead of the regular ones. If you are a vegetarian, make sure that you include a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet throughout the week other than the regular ones. These fruits and vegetables should be local and seasonal to where you live. If you are mostly on an animal based diet, make sure to also include vegetables and fruits in your diet as it has been shown that a vegetarian based diet because of its high fibre content helps in maintaining good gut health and keep gut inflammation away.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Probiotic Foods</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Now, probiotic foods are foods that have live bacteria in them. And these foods are recommended for maintaining a healthy balance of microbes in our gut. Probiotic foods like Curd, Kanji or Kimchi are produced by fermentation where these bacteria grow and multiply in the food. Not only do probiotic foods have better live bacteria than them, but the process of fermentation also boosts certain nutrients in these foods like folic acid. Bottom line is probiotic foods should be made a part of our daily diet, something as simple as a bowl of curd every day, is the easiest way to do it.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Prebiotic Foods</h2>


<p class="post-text">Don't confuse prebiotics and probiotics. Prebiotics do not have life bacteria in them. Prebiotics help in the growth of beneficial microbes in our gut. Prebiotic foods are mostly fibre and complex carbohydrates that cannot be digested by human cells, but this serve as food for some varieties of microbes in our gut. These microbes ferment the prebiotic foods and produce products like short chain fatty acids that are required for maintaining good gut health and for promoting weight loss in our body. In short, prebiotic foods help in feeding the beneficial microbes in our gut which in turn help us in maintaining good health. </p>

<br>
<p class="post-text">One of the best prebiotic foods is bananas. Banana has the fibre called inulin which acts as food for the beneficial microbes in our gut. Foods that are otherwise considered fattening like rice potatoes, sabudana or cassava are excellent prebiotics. These foods have something called resistance starch, which is added as food for the gut bacteria.
</p>
<br>

<p class="post-text">Other than these three tips that I mentioned, which include including a diversity of food in your diet, consuming probiotic foods and prebiotic foods. Some things like reducing your stress levels, maintaining good sleep habits, and avoiding excess sugar in the diet are also helpful in maintaining good health. The importance of good health and its association with our physical health and mental health cannot be ignored. Many dietitians and nutritionists believe in healing the gut for healing the body.
