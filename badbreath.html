	<p class="post-text">Don't think that living a life of mouthwash, four times a day is always going to cure your bad breath.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Food remains on your teeth because you don't brush and you don't floss. Food just sits in your mouth and is degraded by bacteria and you can just imagine the odour that that gives off.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Be sure that when you brush your teeth at night. A lot of people don't realise that when food just sits in your mouth overnight, in the morning your breath will be far stronger than you could ever imagine.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">And brush your tongue, bacteria accumulates in the back surface of your tongue and can also cause strong odour.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Also be sure to drink a lot of water. When your mouth becomes more dry, you have less saliva, and when you have less saliva, food and bacteria tends to sit in your mouth for a much longer period of time.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Also remember that there are other things beyond just being thirsty that can make your mouth dry for example even some medications, coffee, alcohol, smoking which is never a good idea.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">And even some medications can cause dry mouth, if you find that your breath is strong no matter what you do, if you find that you're constantly having to use mouthwash which really often just camouflages bad odour, you may have something else going on than poor hygiene.</p>
	<p class="post-text">So in that instance, it's really important to see your dentist. Because other things that can't be cured by just brushing, flossing and watching what you eat might be going on.</p>
