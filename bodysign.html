	<p class="post-text">Whenever you are deficient in a particular vitamin or mineral, your body gives a whole bunch of signs and signals. Let us talk about some of the most common signals and more. Importantly, the natural ways to fix these deficiencies.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Let's start. While bending, do your knees pop, when you bend them, does your arm crack often ? If yes, then this is a clear sign of calcium deficiency in the body. Of course, we know how important calcium is to maintain strong bones and teeth.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Low calcium levels ? So how to fix it, include milk and milk products along with peanut butter in your diet. However, the most effective way to fulfil calcium deficiency is to have a pinch of calcium carbonate incurred on an empty stomach, have it regularly for about two to three months and it will do wonders.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">If your gums bleed, while brushing or even while eating or your tongue often gets ulcers cuts etc, then you should understand that your body is telling you that it is deficient in vitamin C, bleeding gums while brushing is extremely common even though the majority of people ignore it.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Body signals what's happening at the cellular level. Make sure you act on this immediately as it can aggravate and lead to more serious issues.
The best way to fulfil the vitamin C deficiency in the body is to include Amla or Indian Gooseberry. Amla can be consumed throughout the year in the form of juice, Vitamin etc. Other good sources of vitamin C include lemons, guavas, oranges, capsicums etc. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Do you have big brittle nails or do you suffer from peeling cuticles? Maybe your hair is dry or you are facing premature hair fall? These are some very clear indications that your body is deficient in biotin.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Common reason could be when you regularly start eating raw eggs. Biotin is made by the body using certain friendly bacteria in the gut. Whenever there is an imbalance in the digestive system, our body is unable to make it, due to which the symptoms come up.</p>
	<p class="post-text">The best way to increase biotin production in the body is to increase gut friendly bacteria and there isn't a better probiotic food than curd. Have during empty stomach with one teaspoon of jaggery powder mixed in it to get the maximum benefit.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Check your nails. Do you have any small white specks on them? If yes, then this means that your body is craving for zinc. Zinc deficiency is very common among people who eat less. Zinc is a trace mineral. But it is very important for both men and women. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">This is because it is required for male body to produce testosterone, so low zinc means low testosterone levels, which may lead to slow beard growth, low muscle mass, fatigue and even sexually.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Majority in women, especially during pregnancy zinc deficiency may negatively affect the foetus and mother to fulfil, think reduce your intake of pastries, increase nuts, seeds. Lentils and legumes in your diet.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Now let's talk a bit more about B vitamins. If you have cracked corners of heels or bloodshot eyes or cracking corners of my mouth, it's vitamin B2 deficiency. If you find horizontal lines on your nails or you suffer from wandering eyes, it is an indication of vitamin B1 deficiency.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Then if there is redness around the nose, cheeks and foreheads. You need to supply the body with vitamin B6. The deficiency of B vitamins is very common and is linked to the problems of skin, hair and the digestive system.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">People deficient in B vitamins are more prone to body pain, anxiety and depression. The major reason for B Vitamin deficiency is poor food choices. Stop excessively eating pizza, burgers, donuts, chips, biscuits, wafers etc.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Nails are turning white or your lips are losing their colour, then these are the classic symptoms of low iron and haemoglobin levels in the body. Iron and haemoglobin are interlinked as iron is essential for the production of blood. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Boiling, milk, beetroots, carrots, pomegranates and cone apples. They are very helpful in improving the haemoglobin level. It is also recommended to massage your body, and exercise.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Another very familiar signal given by the body shows up in the form of vertical ridges on nails, or loss of eyebrow or puffy eyes. Do you know where the root of these problems lie? It's the thyroid. The thyroid hormone regulates your body's metabolism and the way your body utilises carbs, fats and proteins.</p>
	<p class="post-text">So any problem with the thyroid gland, it can create further deficiencies in the body. As the hormonal events are much more in women. They are more prone to these symptoms. Actually a lot can be done about this lifestyle disease to start with eating home-cooked food and exercise regularly.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Then if you have uneven nails or your night vision is poor, then you should know that it is vitamin A deficiency. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Another common signal is when your tongue turns white, this indicates yeast overgrowth and there are issues with the digestive system.
Avoid antibiotics, eat cleansing foods like raw vegetables, and fruits. Basically, for every internal activity going on in the body, it has some significance. Not to make you panic about certain nutrient deficiencies. But just to make you aware of these small deficiencies when not acted upon may lead to something big.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">At the same time, our body is very intelligent. It takes care of small deficiencies here and there so we need not panic. We need not go for synthetic tablets. All we need to do is eat a balanced diet as much as possible.</p>
