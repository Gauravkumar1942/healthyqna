	<p class="post-text">You're tired a lot, your belly or back is constantly bothering you and the weight is just falling off but not because you wanted to. These symptoms might be a reality for someone who is living with pancreatic cancer. In 2019, pancreatic cancer was the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. 45,886 people lost their lives to it.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Pancreas is essential for digestion and it's essential for digestion and maintaining the body's blood sugar levels. Mutations can cause pancreatic cells to multiply out of control, which forms tumours.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Pancreatic cancer is harder to detect and usually found in advanced stages. That's why it's important to know the signs and to talk to your health care provider as soon as you notice changes with your health. Here are six signs of pancreatic cancer to watch out for.
</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Yellowing of Eyes/Skin</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Yellowing of the eyes and skin also known as jaundice is often the first symptoms that people experience. It's caused by the build-up of bilirubin -  dark yellow brown substance made in the liver.  When pancreatic cancer blocks the bile duct, it causes bilirubin to build up and keeps it from getting to the intestines.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Pain in Belly/Back</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Pancreatic tumours can become pretty large and can be quite painful. This type of cancer can also affect the nerves around the pancreas and cause back pain.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Unintended Weight Loss</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Weight loss is another common symptom and people with pancreatic cancer will often have little to no appetite.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Changes in Blood Sugar</h2>


	<p class="post-text">It's rare, but some forms of pancreatic cancer can destroy cells that make insulin. This can cause a person to pee a lot and feel hungry and thirsty. In other cases it can lead to changes in blood sugar that don't trigger any symptoms at all. However blood tests can detect these changes.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Nausea/Vomiting</h2>


	<p class="post-text">When cancer tumours block the stomach, food can't get through, this leads to nausea and vomiting after meals.</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">6. Enlarged Gall Bladder/Liver</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Pancreatic cancer can even block the bile duct and cause the gallbladder to get bigger.  If it spreads, it can also increase the size of the liver. Healthcare providers might be able to feel these changes during an exam or they can spot them with imaging tests.</p>



	<p class="post-text">You hear this time and time again, but it's important to remember, if you see something, say something, talk to your doctor. If you start noticing some of the symptoms mentioned, they can examine you and run tests to rule things out. Waiting will only make things worse or lessen the chances for successful treatment for survival. Don't ignore the signs. Tell your doctor  right away and get the help you need. </p>
