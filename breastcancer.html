	<p class="post-text">In the United States,  Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among people assigned female at birth and one of the leading causes of death. Everyone has breast tissue which means anyone can develop breast cancer.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">In fact, cisgender women are at especially high risk as transgender men and non-binary people who have not undergone a mastectomy and although it's less common. People assigned male at birth can develop breast cancer while hereditary factors can contribute to your likelihood of getting breast cancer.</p>
	<p class="post-text">The reality is that 90 to 95 percent of breast cancer cases are sporadic meaning they're not related to any known genetic predispositions. So it's important that you know what might be signs of breast cancer. By performing monthly breast self-exams you can become familiar with the normal monthly changes in your breasts and be primed to notice any worrisome changes.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Make sure to do it at the same time each month. If you menstruate you should do the self exam three to five days after your period ends. So what are the warning signs of breast cancer: pay attention to any new lumps or thickening of the skin on your breasts or of a pebble can be cause for concern.</p>
	<p class="post-text">You may also feel a small hardened area under the skin, not quite a lump, but not normal either. Be on lookout for any changes in the general size, shape or contour of your breasts particularly if those changes happen on one side, but not the other.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Tell your doctor if you notice a change in the look or feel of the skin on the breast or nipple like puckered skin, redness, a scaly texture or general inflammation. Pay attention to other changes to the nipples like if one nipple sinks, or if you notice a clear or reddish fluid discharge.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">If you notice one or more of these signs, schedule an appointment to talk to your doctor. Keep in mind that most lumps and abnormalities aren't cancer but it's important to get checked out.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Doing regular breast self-exams is a great way to maintain breast health and detect cancer early when it's easier to treat and more likely to be cured. So think and get to know your breasts. Self-exams are an act of self care and they just might save your life.</p>
