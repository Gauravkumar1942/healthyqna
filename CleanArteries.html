	<p class="post-text">We will discuss why our arteries get clogged, the warning signs that the body gives, the best foods and the three most effective ways to unclog the arteries, and prevent heart attack. Why is it important to unclog the arteries? Consider a road with heavy traffic, how hard it is to move forward. A similar situation happens when arteries get clogged due to cholesterol build up and the blood has a tough time moving forward. This puts you at a risk of a heart attack. So how do we know that our arteries are blocked? </p>
	<p class="post-text">Well, a simple lipid profile test is a short way to know the status of your heart health. However, if one is proactive enough, there are certain signs that can indicate high cholesterol. Since cholesterol build up in the arteries causes inflammation. Pain in the left side of the chest is a sign that one should not ignore, then shortness of breath, the feeling that you can't breath.  Apart from this tiredness, weak memory and cramps in the legs may be a sign of high cholesterol.  But why does cholesterol get built up ?  Bad food choices are the major cause of bad cholesterol. It's important to know that there are two types of cholesterol: good and bad.</p>
<p class="post-text">Bad cholesterol sticks to artery walls and causes blockage. On the other hand, good cholesterol has essential functions to perform including reducing the bad cholesterol. So we should aim to increase good cholesterol and decrease bad cholesterol. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Red meat is a major source of bad cholesterol. A 2019 study confirmed that people who eat plant-based diets have 52% less chances of heart attack. Another major cause of clogged arteries is the consumption of bad oils. When foods are fried or when oils are reused, bad cholesterol builds up. Hydrogenated oils found in packaged foods like cream biscuits, commercial peanut butters and cheese, have trans fats. Trans fat increases bad cholesterol. Packaged foods consisting of refined sugar, spike the insulin that increases cholesterol production. Apart from this being overweight, having a sedentary lifestyle, smoking and binge drinking puts one at a risk of high cholesterol.</p>
	<p class="post-text">So how can we reduce this cholesterol buildup and cleanse our arteries? Statin Drugs are often prescribed for the same. Although the problem with statin tablets is that cholesterol remains in control, only as long as you're consuming them. More importantly, they are known to have side effects like liver damage, impotency, and muscle weakness. Why risk your health, when arteries can be cleansed naturally? Ayurvedic scriptures talk at length about the various herbs that help reduce cholesterol. Out of so many, I have selected three ways which are easy, practical and effective.
</p>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Garlic</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Although not recommended as daily food but can do wonders if you use it as medicine. Unsurprisingly more than 25 studies have confirmed that having just one raw garlic significantly reduces cholesterol clog. Garlic contains vitamin C, B6, manganese and selenium but it's the bioactive compound called Allicin, a type of antioxidant that is responsible for lowering the bad cholesterol and reducing blood pressure.</p>
	<p class="post-text">Needless to say, garlic is available in almost every kitchen. For best results, have one clove daily with water, one hour before breakfast. Easy on pocket, efficacious,  garlic is a natural remedy to unblock arteries. Second option is
</p>
	

	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Arjuna Bark</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Arjuna Bark is probably the most effective herb for the heart. So much so that it is often termed as a cardiovascular herb. Having strong antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and blood thinning properties. It not just reduces the level of bad cholesterol and triglycerides. But it also increases good Cholesterol.</p>
	<p class="post-text">In a study, when Arjuna Bark powder was consumed for one month, it reduced triglycerides by almost 18% and bad cholesterol by 16% and increased good cholesterol by 10%, overall an amazing tonic for cleansing. </p>
	<p class="post-text">You can have a teaspoon of powder with boiled milk or water, filter it and then sweeten it with honey or jaggery powder. Have it post break first and in the evening. If Arjun tea is not your cup of tea, arjun bark is available in the form of tablet and syrup as well. Both can be consumed post meals.</p>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Medohar Guggulu</h2>

	
	<p class="post-text">Medohar Guggulu (medha means “fat tissue” and har means “to eradicate”). As its name suggests, this guggul based ayurvedic classical formulation is proven to reduce bad cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In a study when Medohar Guggulu was given with other ayurvedic medicines, it showed mind boggling results reducing bad cholesterol and triglyceride levels by a whopping 30%. To get the maximum benefit, it is recommended to chew 2 tablets with lukewarm water twice, preferably after food in morning and evening. Each of these three remedies are powerful in their own aspect, you can choose as per your convenience. Follow it religiously for two months and then get your lipid profile test done again. You won't be disappointed.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Apart from these solutions, there are certain foods which help cleanse the arteries. Foods with healthy fats, like cow’s ghee (buttery stuff extracted from milk after a centrifugal process) , nuts, coconut and flax seeds, help eliminate bad cholesterol in the body. Bottle gourd, other members of the gourd family are highly effective in cleansing arteries, fiberage foods like seasonal fruits and whole grains especially oats help cut cholesterol out from the body. Interestingly, when a group of men and women were given just four brazil nuts to eat, cholesterol was reduced by 20 units in just nine hours. You can easily get them online.</p>
