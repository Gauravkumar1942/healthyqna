	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Excessively Sweating</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Sweating is a totally normal thing, especially if you've just taken a long run or it's a particularly hot day. Sweating seems a little excessive or not brought on by anything particularly obvious. However, it can be a sign that you're lacking vitamin D. If you notice that you're sweating excessively even if it's not that hot out, you may want to ask your doctor  about it.</p>
	<p class="post-text">As for many new parents out there. It's worth noting that infants who sweat excessively are often suspected of having a vitamin D deficiency.</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Bone Aches</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Our bones often ache as you get older.  It's pretty common to experience sore joints in aching bones, but bone pain can be a sign of a vitamin D deficiency. You've probably heard that you need calcium for strong bones. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Without vitamin D, your  bones can't absorb the necessary amount of calcium to create healthy bones.  Issues like weakening of the bones known as osteomalacia, this can lead to a sensitivity in your bones. It can result in fractures and bone diseases like osteoporosis.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Muscle Pain</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Have you ever noticed that your muscles feel sore and take a while to get back to normal after a workout? This is pretty normal since exercise causes microscopic tears in the muscle fibres that take some time to heal.</p>
	<p class="post-text">However, if you feel like your muscles become sore, really easily and for a long amount of time, it may be because you're not getting enough vitamin D. In addition to aching bones and muscles, a lack of vitamin D can cause chronic pain throughout the entire body.</p>
	<p class="post-text">This debilitating condition is known as fibromyalgia and it makes life a living nightmare for those who suffer from it.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Frequent Sickness</h2>


	<p class="post-text">Do you get sick all the time ?. It may be because of a lack of vitamin D. It is causing your immune system to work poorly. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">In her 2011 study, Dr. Cynthia  of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research found that cells in the immune system were actually able to synthesise when exposed to vitamin D. What does that mean, it means that now, autoimmune diseases could be treated with vitamin D.</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Fatigue</h2>


	<p class="post-text">You can't seem to stay energised. It's 4pm and you feel like you have two bricks as eyelids and barely have the strength to get up from your desk. There could be quite a few reasons for this feeling, like staying up a little too late the night before, but it can also be due to a lack of vitamin D. If you feel unusually fatigued every day and can't seem to shake it, it may be worth talking to a doctor about it. I know it's really tasty and refreshing but relying on coffee all the time isn't always the best solution.
