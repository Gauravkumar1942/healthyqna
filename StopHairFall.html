	<p class="post-text">If you are suffering from hair fall and thinning of hair, there are five foods that you must include in your diet. Not only these foods are easily available but more importantly they are backed by ayurveda and proven by modern science. We will discuss how and when to consume them so that you can get maximum benefit from it. There is no doubt that our body gives low priority to hair. This is why when our body doesn't get adequate nutrition, it ignores hair and focuses on other organs.</p>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Carrot</h2>
	<p class="post-text">Studies have shown a strong connection between carrot and Vitamin A. Apart from vitamin A, carrots have a significant amount of biotin, which is well known for accelerating keratin production. Keratin is the protein from which hair is made. You will be surprised to know that carrots are natural DHT blocker food. Science confirms that DHT is one of the main causes of hair fall. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Especially for many, the hair supplementation industry runs on two things, biotin and DHT blocking pills, both of which are present in carrots. No wonder today, carrot oil is also making the rounds in that space. In fact, in a study, when a group applied carrot oil on the scalp within a few days, it was seen that it was more constructive as compared to 1% minoxidil solution. Carrot also contains vital hair nutrients like vitamin E, C and K along with strong antioxidants, that prevent ageing of hair. So if you are suffering from hair fall or your hair is thinning down, you should include carrots in the form of veggies, soups or vegetable pulao. Although, the best would be to have carrot salad every day before lunch or dinner. If you have a plate of raw carrots and spice it up with black salt, black pepper and lemon. This hair superfood won't let you down. </p>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Curry Leaves</h2>


	<p class="post-text">If one starts consuming curry leaves on a regular basis, not only will hair breakage be reduced but also hair health will get much better. That's because curry leaves are an amazing source of B vitamins and antioxidants, which contribute to cellular regeneration and promote healthy circulation of blood. Making it among the top foods to prevent hair fall and hair thinning. The amino acid content, which strengthens hair fibre, is also very high in curry leaves. Surveys have shown that people in the southern part of India have significantly lesser hair problems. One concrete reason is that they use curry leaves for dals and vegetables, curd rice, poha, curry leaf pulao. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">If you are suffering from hair fall, you should try and make curry leaves a part of your daily diet. Curry leaf trees are so common in India, pluck 4 to 5 curry leaves, and simply chew them, chew them well so that they turn into liquid in your mouth. It will hardly take 2 minutes. Within a few weeks, you will visibly notice a difference in your head. One can also get curry leaf powder online. It can be used as a regular spice. So, for the next two months, include curry leaves in your diet, in whichever way is convenient to you and get ready to bring back your good hair days.
</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Butter Milk</h2>
	<p class="post-text">Buttermilk or well turned yoghurt mixed with double the amount of water and spiced appropriately is good for hair. Consider a plant whose leaves are falling, what could be the reason? The problem lies with the leaves, quite obviously, the problem lies with the roots of the plant. Similarly, according to ayurveda, the root cause of hair fall lies in the stomach.</p>
	<p class="post-text">In fact, when an 86 year old Chinese man suffering from alopecia went through a faecal transplant. A sudden hair regrowth was seen. So if you are facing indigestion, your body won't be able to absorb the vital hair nutrients from the food. And as a result hair gets weaker and eventually falls. Butter milk also reduces body heat, another major cause of falling hair. Buttermilk is an excellent hair shampoo, plus conditioner as well, two in one.
</p>

<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Amla or Indian Gooseberry</h2>

	<p class="post-text">Amla are time tested traditional medicine, not only in India but also in other countries to promote hair and scalpel. Not surprisingly, today every hair product out there is either a shampoo conditioner or a hair oil post online, emphasising on talking about amla hair oil. </p>
	<p class="post-text">There was a study done on rabbits and rats. Researchers placed patches containing amla oil in various concentrations on the animals fur and monitored for growth for 15 days. What they found was that amla oil caused significant and rather rapid growth. Clinical studies show that Amla acts as a powerful hair regenerator stimulating the hair follicles and strengthening the roots. A study proved that Amla is among the top DHT blocking foods. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Amla is filled with all good things, but the problem is that it's too sour to consume, but don't worry. There are some real good ways in which you can easily consume Amla. I'll share with you five such ways. First, you can buy Amla juice of any reputable brand and dilute it with equal amounts of water and have it 30 minutes before breakfast. Amla candy with honey and amla murabba with honey are two healthy snack options that you can keep handy with yourself. Anytime of the day, raw amla and boiled with rice or curry gets easy to eat and can be consumed as pickles. 
</p>

	<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Almonds</h2>


	<p class="post-text">It's amazing to know how much almonds have to offer to hair. Almonds are probably the best food source of biotin making them an excellent natural alternative to artificial biotin supplements. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Science has shown that application of almond oil to the scalp increases hair growth. In another study when rats were divided into six groups. Almond, and one group with five other supplements, including minoxidil and others. After 30 days, the almond extract group beat the other five in opening up new hair follicles. Almonds contain special fatty acids, like oleic acid and linoleic acid, which are proven DHT blockers. Vitamin E is another proven anti-hairfall nutrient for which almonds are a dependable source.</p>
