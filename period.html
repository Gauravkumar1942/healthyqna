	<p class="post-text">I'm going to share with you five common mistakes that women make during their periods that become the reason for problems like PCOD, thyroid and urinary tract infection, and even aggravate PMS symptoms like cramps and bloating. We will also discuss how to prevent these mistakes and the best practices.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Interestingly, every month a woman's body prepares for pregnancy but when pregnancy doesn't happen the entire preparation is shed in the form of a monthly period. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">During menses, a woman's body is highly sensitive. Hence utmost care should be taken as it can put her health at risk. Let's talk about five mistakes that every woman should avoid during her periods and the best practices. Number five mistake is the

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">5. Wrong Diet</h2>




	<p class="post-text">What you eat during your period can have a huge impact on how easy or tough your period will be traditionally. Women were advised to eat warm foods during menstruation so that the blood flow can happen smoothly. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">This is the reason sesame seeds, dried coconut and jaggery sweets were considered a must for menstruating women. To consume ice cold water, cold drinks and other cooling foods is a mistake that one should strive to avoid. Only healthy foods like salad, especially post sunset, black coffee, green tea and unsoaked nuts are drying for the body which can become the reason for menstrual cramps and bloating. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Since digestion is naturally low during menses, deep fried and other heavy foods are best avoided during this time of the month. A 2015 study found that people who are magnesium deficient are more likely to have severe PMS symptoms. And do you know, what is the number one reason for magnesium deficiency? It's regular consumption of durotic beverages, like alcohol and soft drinks. </p>
	<p class="post-text">To replenish magnesium, eat green, the gourd family, green capsicum, green pumpkin, and all green leafy. Vegetables should be a part of your period diet. The added advantage of having greens is that they are iron rich, which is the need of hour as the body loses blood. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Another proven food to reduce PMS symptoms is turmeric. Traditionally, turmeric water was considered a must during menstruation. Ginger was proven in 2018 to be an ideal food to be consumed during periods naturally warm. It keeps period problems at day. Ginger tea can replace your evening tea during menstruation. The key is to eat warm and fresh home cooked food, and avoid cold natured and drying foods. Number four mistake is having a 

</p>
<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">4. Head Bath</h2>

	<p class="post-text">A modern doctor might shed this off as a myth passed on from generations, head bath is bound to aggravate period problems. Have you observed that menstruation has the tendency to temporarily stop during a shower? The same happens while swimming. Believe it or not, but having a head bath during periods hinders the flow of blood almost instantly. This is because when water is poured on the head, the temperature of the upper part of the body reduces now to balance the temperature, heat energy flows, from downward to upward. This is exactly the opposite to what is required during a period. This even affects the next ovulation.</p>
	<p class="post-text">In fact, I don't recommend bathing during periods but since that might not be feasible in today's era, it is best to take birth using lukewarm water or avoid head bath altogether. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Another thing to make your period experience even better is to add a teaspoon of epsom salt in bathing water. This magnesium rich natural salt is easily available at any chemist shop and works wonders to relax uterine muscles, relieving cramping and muscle tension while promoting optimal sleep. Number three, the mistake is</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">3. Over-Exerting Yourself</h2>



	<p class="post-text">Should you work out during a period? Well, the answer is yes and no. All though, doing some light exercise on your period has been proven to minimise many symptoms, such as pain, cramps,  bloating, mood swings and fatigue on the flip side, doing high intensity or long workouts can rather create complexities.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">This is the reason why high intensity athletes often miss out on their period or have a scanty flow. The best exercise to do on your period is Pranayam. 10 minutes of Anulom Vilom is highly recommended. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Walking in a park or post dinner under the moonlight will not only make you feel good but will balance your hormones. Light cardio or aerobic exercise if your body allows may be considered gentle strength training and stretching are good as well.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">To compromise on sleep is the worst abuse that one can hurt during periods. In fact, the body requires more rest. Overexertion can cause severe problems like PCOD in the long run. Number two mistake is to have 

</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">2. Sexual Intercourse</h2>



	<p class="post-text">During periods, 500 women were surveyed between the age of 18 and 50 years. It was found that 82% of women have sex during their period. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Sex during periods is just messy. But according to Ayurveda, it is the worst thing to do especially during the first three days of a period, this creates an imbalance in women bodies causing painful periods and bloating.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Well, if the partners still insist, inform them that it's no picnic for their health. Either modern science, all consider sex during menstrual periods as safe. However, since the virus lives in blood, without using barrier methods like condoms, the chances of sexually transmitted infections, like hepatitis 2 increases, as bacteria can easily travel to the bladder with intercourse. </p>
	<p class="post-text">Experts say that sexual intercourse during menstruation is a possible risk for the development of endometriosis. Period is the time when a woman's body is naturally cleansing itself. </p>
	<p class="post-text">The body is weak due to loss of blood. Hence, sexual intercourse is best avoided. Finally, the number one mistake is using a 
</p>

<br><br>
	<h2 class="sub-heading">1. Sanitary Pads</h2>



	<p class="post-text">If you are still using the commercial sanitary napkins and tampons then it is high time you make a switch. Do you know that these white looking sanitary pads are not originally white. </p>
	<p class="post-text">They are bleached with many harmful chemicals to give that bright white look. In a recent study, it was found that almost every popular sanitary pad emits volatile organic compounds that have the potential to imbalance the hormone. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Dioxin in these pads is basically a carcinogen which means it encourages the creation of cancer causing cells in your body. Shockingly, it was found that these harmful substances get absorbed 18 to 20 times, more through vaginal opening than oral. What's worse? There is no regulatory body to keep a check on what goes inside on making these so-called hygienic sanitary pads.
</p>
	<p class="post-text">According to experts, tampons since they are inserted into the vagina are worse than a sanitary pad. So, ditch these dangerous products and switch to natural biodegradable pads, cloth pads, or the best option would be to use a menstrual cup. 
</p>
	<p class="post-text">Another common mistake is that women often wear a sanitary pad for too long. Moisture provides a breeding ground for bacteria and fungus and hence wearing a pad for too long can lead to an infection depending on the blood flow.</p>
	<p class="post-text"> Research suggests that a woman should change her pad within four to eight hours.</p>
